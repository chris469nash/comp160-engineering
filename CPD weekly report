## Semester 2

## Week 1
The first week was an amalgamation of getting used to the 9am starts and also making sure i'd gotten everything together. The first week was quite compact with lectures and workshops. I attended the Unreal Engine blueprints workshop but didn't get much done as it was hard to hear Brian over everyone else. We had our first PO meeting this week and had began making progress on our game project with the BAs.

## Week 2
Most of the BAs seem to be fairly motivated towards the COMP160 game project, a couple of them appear to have done little to no work over the past week. I have taken a look at multiple Unreal Engine tutorials, i have yet to complete any of them. Over the next few weeks i will attempt to complete these tutorials and see if they could be adapted for use in the Comp160 game project. 

## Week 3
A couple of the BAs wish to change courses but are unable until the end of the year, i feel like this has affected their motivation towards the game project and therefore are proucing very little or no work whatsoever. The number of members attending the stand-up meetings are reducing each week, i feel like this will affect the motivation of the whole team if it carries on. 

## Week 4
This week i have been rather ill and therefore have missed a few lectures. If i keep missing lectures then i fear i will penalise myself in the long run, i need to ensure that i will attend every lecture i have in future. 

## Week 5


## Week 6
This week we had a look at the arduinos we will be working with within the COMP140 module. We had been given the components to emit a light to the 3 LEDs we had been given. I found this rather interesting, I intend to follow up more about the arduino and how it works.

## Week 7
I have ordered the comonents for my arduino this week, they consist of a few buttons and also a slide potentiometer. I will use the slide potentiometer for movement for left and right and also the buttons for the fire and jump mechanics within my prototype game.

## Week 8


## Week 9


## Week 10
This week I have managed to put my arduino together, I had run into a few issues trying to wire it all up without making too much of a mess on the breadboard with all the wires and components. The controller appears to be working correctly and implementing into Unreal wasn't too difficult with the help of Brian and Phil. 

## Week 11

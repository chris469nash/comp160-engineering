I propose to complete my essay on the following question:
# What precautions must be taken into account during the software development stages while localising software?
I propose to underline the key components needed within localised software while developig it. I will go through each component thoroughly with relevant references to assist and also back up my key points. I will also describe how to go through the quality assurance stages of the development and the limitations the quality assurance stages can be hard to determine the overall quality of the software.
